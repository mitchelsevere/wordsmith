## What is Wordsmith?

> Wordsmith is a elegant lyrics based website from most of your favorite artists around the globe. The lyrics are powered by Genius.

## Technical Discussion

> Full stack application using Node JS / Express / Postgres backend. Used NPM module lyricist to scrape lyrics from Genius. Used Genius API to gather artist, song and image metadata. Pug was used for the view engine. I also used jQuery for simple DOM manipulation.

### Notes on App Structure

> Created two helper functions to grab the lyrics from my npm module (getLyrics)  based off of the id of my getSingle function. Made them async functions since   I was using the new await javascript keyword.
``` js
async function getLyrics(id) {
  const song = await lyricist.song(id, { 
    fetchLyrics: true,
    textFormat: 'html',
  });
  return song.lyrics;
}

async function getSingle(req, res, next) {
  let id = req.query.id;
  res.locals.lyrics = await getLyrics(id);
  fetch(`http://api.genius.com/songs/${id}/?access_token=${process.env.API_KEY}`)
  .then(fetchRes => fetchRes.json())
  .then(jsonRes => {
    res.locals.single = jsonRes.response;
    return next();
  }).catch(err => {
    console.log(err);
    return next();
  });
}
```

## Opportunities for Future Growth

> I would love to add lyrics on the users favorites on the next version.
> Add a some page transitions and other smooth DOM animations
> Mobile friendly design
> A little cleaner astethic
